         *
         * The X-Frame-Options header is not set in the HTTP response, meaning the page can potentially be loaded into
         * an attacker-controlled frame. This could lead to clickjacking, where an attacker adds an invisible layer on
         * top of the legitimate page to trick users into clicking on a malicious link or taking a harmful action.
         *
         * The X-Frame-Options allows three values: DENY, SAMEORIGIN and ALLOW-FROM. It is recommended to use DENY,
         * which prevents all domains from framing the page or SAMEORIGIN, which allows framing only by the same site.
         * DENY and SAMEORGIN are supported by all browsers.
         * Using ALLOW-FROM is not recommended because not all browsers support it.
         *
